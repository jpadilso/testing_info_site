White Box Testing: An Inside Look
Quick Summary

In White Box Testing, the tester is like an open book; they are fully aware of the internals of the item being tested.
Alternate Names

Also known as Internal Testing or Clear Box Testing.
Key Characteristics

    Knowledge Level: The tester knows the nitty-gritty details of how the code works and what its intended functionalities are.
    Rigorousness: This is a lower-level, more rigorous form of testing that dives deep into the codebase.
    Time Factor: Due to its thoroughness, White Box Testing is often time-consuming.

Real-world Examples

    Unit Testing: This involves testing your own code right after you write it to ensure it behaves as expected.
    Path Testing: This includes testing every if-else case in your code to ensure all paths execute correctly.

Black Box Testing: The Enigma
Quick Summary

In Black Box Testing, the tester is like a detective with a sealed envelope; they don't know the internals of what they're testing.
Alternate Names

Also referred to as External Testing or Closed Testing.
Key Characteristics

    Knowledge Level: The tester may know what the code is supposed to do, but they have no idea how it does it.
    Rigorousness: This is a higher-level, less rigorous form of testing.
    Time Factor: Black Box Testing is generally more time-efficient than White Box Testing.

Real-world Examples

    Functional Testing: This involves checking function outputs in response to a series of inputs.
    Non-Functional Testing: This covers general usability aspects like speed, security, and reliability.

Grey Box Testing: The Balanced Warrior
Quick Summary

Grey Box Testing is like a detective with a partially redacted file; they have some internal information but not all.
Alternate Names

Also known as Gray Box Testing.
Key Characteristics

    Knowledge Level: The tester has access to design specifications and documentation, such as UML and database diagrams.
    Tester-Developer Boundary: Grey Box Testing maintains a boundary between testers and developers, unlike White Box Testing.
    Code Access: Unlike White Box testing, the tester does not have access to the source code.
    Information Level: Compared to Black Box Testing, the tester has more insights into the item being tested.

Real-world Examples

    API Testing: When you test an API using its documentation to guide your tests.
    Design Requirement Testing: Ensuring the software meets its initial design requirements as laid out in the specification documents.
